# CountryMan
Small Android-Kotlin project telling different things about countries. Based on GraphQL API of https://countries.trevorblades.com/

### Notes, plans
* MVVM, apollo-android, and so on
* To be designed XD
* Local disk cache by apollo, of course, needed (nearest future)
* Dagger and Databinding may be added in the near future
* May be published on Google Play if trevorblades allows it in their policy
* Some more useful info may be added (like country's currency to USD rate, typical wheather etc)
